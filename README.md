Description:

Python script that scans the users home directory and emits a list of all files and folders
at the top level sorted by their size -- largest to smallest. With an optional argument,
other directories thatn /home/$USER can be scanned and sorted in the same manner. The script
is meant to be a useful tool to clean up large and messy folders on devices with limited
disk resources.

Useage:

 scan_my_home.sh [directory]
